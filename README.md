# Mira Markdown

A markdown extension for VS Code and Cursor with enhanced heading decorations and a clean rendered preview.

## Features

### Preview Button

Click the **Preview** button in the status bar (bottom-left) to open a rendered preview of your markdown file. The button appears automatically when editing a markdown file. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+V` (`Cmd+Shift+V` on Mac).

The preview renders your markdown as it would appear on a web page — proportional fonts, styled headings, code blocks, tables, and more.

### Enhanced Heading Display

Headings are visually distinct in source mode with bold styling and scaled font sizes:

- **H1** — Bold, 1.6em
- **H2** — Bold, 1.4em
- **H3** — Bold, 1.2em
- **H4–H6** — Bold

### No Split Pane

The built-in side-by-side markdown preview is intentionally disabled. Mira Markdown opens the preview as a separate tab so you can focus on one view at a time — either source or preview, not both competing for screen space.
